    <p>1. Research password managers and multi-factor authentication. Consider setting up a password manager and using multi-factor authentication on your Apple, Facebook, Google, and/or Microsoft accounts, as well as your password manager and your financial institutions.
      In my research of password managers I found a list of 9 of the best ranked managers and their different perks and specialties. The items ranked were USA based and promise secure connections for your passwords and account connections. The first ranked on is Nordpass, they advertise a data breach scanner, automatic syncing across devices and unlimited password saving. This list of managers and Nordpass are useful for the workplace because of its information about the different password managers and their benefits. For example if a company is looking for a manager with data leak protection they would look for Nordpass. This is useful information for my personal use as I predict in the future I will be working on the internet with a need for password protection to deter hacking.

<p>2. Test your firewall using a testing service such as Gibson Research: ShieldsUP!
When I ran the firewall test for my network it came up as the system did not respond to their UPnP probes. It goes on to explain what this means and that the network I am using is closed and there is no one scanning my information from my network. The UPnP is a zero authentication system that does not require a password to access it. This system was never meant to have access to the larger internet but due to router manufacturers it does, they are attempting to remedy this by installing high security. This is important to know because you should be checking your firewall occasionally to ensure your network is secure. This affects me because I use the internet and technology on a daily basis and internet security is necessary to ensure your content is safe from malware.
