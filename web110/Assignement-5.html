    <p>Screen Sharing / Remote Desktop
Research remote desktop applications and use one of the following programs to remotely connect to another computer:
The google remote control for connecting to other computers is useful to control another user's computer while not interfering with the computer's controls. The google program uses a proprietary protocol to transmit the inputs of the mouse and keyboard of the client to the server which is then translated to the network and sent to the host computer. In general this service can be used for tech help when not in person as well as ensuring the same service is done across several computers. For example this can be used in an office setting to help explain a new software to a client or provide information about a tech update to an employee.

    <p>Intellectual Property
Review RIAA:About Piracy. Research legal issues and potential penalties related to illegal peer-to-peer file sharing.
When it comes to sharing and copying music it seems the rules are specific and straight to the point. You are not allowed to share or copy music that you haven't bought the rights to or been given permission to copy. An example of an illegal sharing technique is Downloading an app on your smartphone that allows you to take the audio from any YouTube music video and permanently keep that audio in your music collection. This is not allowed for the reason that you have not paid for that music and the owner of the song will not receive credit for the copy you have created. This is useful to know because of the amount of access people have to music and movies online in the modern age. A song can be downloaded and burned onto a CD without the owner of the song even knowing about it. This activity informs about the different forms fo piracy and how it affects the creators of music, tv shows and movies.
